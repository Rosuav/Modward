Tinkering with Windward modding. Why? Because I can.

Full code-level modding will be very similar to KSP modding, and the instructions
actually cite KSP's modding instructions. Lift some of the build system.

Results so far:

* There are some extreme oddities with activating mods; sometimes there's a
  complaint that the map expects different mods, even when first created. This
  may impact multiplayer, possibly even making it impossible.
* Changing a ship's stats does change what shows when you attempt to buy it, but
  aside from cargo capacity, I haven't found an actual effect. The Sloop, with
  my changes, still crawls along at its normal pace.
* Quest modding is interesting. The XP doesn't seem to have an effect, but by
  cranking up the "Reward" (these three all default to a reward of 5), we can see
  neat item rewards from each of the quests.
* I was sure there was an "Allow Modded Players" option somewhere, but I can't
  seem to find it now.
